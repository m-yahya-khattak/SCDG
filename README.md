### 🏙️ General

Created this project for my personal research project as a hobby.

This repository generates __synthetic data of a real city__ (in this case paris) from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data and animates it with the [City Sample](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample) project (pedestrians, cars). 
The synthetic data is captured in several formats (RGB and semantic).<br/>

The objective is to detect AI models biases from this synthetic data. For instance, detect if our crowd counting model is efficient either day and night by submitting two datasets.

### 🧰 Requirements

- [Unreal Engine 5.1.1](https://www.unrealengine.com/fr/unreal-engine-5)

#### Collections and plugins

In your project, you will need to add:

- [City Sample Crowds](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample-crowds)
- [City Sample Vehicles](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample-vehicles)

#### Expected tree

```bash
. [Twincity]
└── Content # Download from the marketplace 👇
  └── City Sample Crowds
  └── City Sample Vehicles
├── [...]
└── Plugins # Create a Plugins folder where you can clone EasySynth repository 👇
    └── EasySynth
```

Semantic views is useful in computer vision to detect objects (pedestrians, buildings, roads, vehicles etc).

##### 📊 Extractor results

Once the user has clicked on "Generate", RGB and semantic datas can be found in /d/Snapchot/ folder. Metadatas file describing screenshots (number of vehicles and peds, peds id and RGB, camera rotation/location, weather...) is also created in /d/.
